#About
This project was created using the ModernWebDev Yeoman Generator by dSebastien.

#How to build
`npm install gulp --global`
`--no-optional ulimit -n 2048`
`npm run setup`
`npm run start`

You will get duplicate identifier typescript errors, but you can ignore those.
$5 if you can fix them. :-P

For more details about the build, refer to the ModernWebDevBuild project documentation.
